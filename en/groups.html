			<h2>1873-1877: the golden years of the <em>Montagnards des Apenins</em> group</h2>
			<div class="quote">
				<p>"Ocarina concert at Crystal Palace - A concert of ocarinas means music played on instruments made of clay, called ocarinas. The ocarina players wearing their characteristic costumes presented themselves to the Haendel Orchestra and played a selection of opera pieces on their instruments called ocarinas with great ability [...]. The audience listened with surprise and enthusiasm to a selection from "Il Trovatore" followed by the Ouverture from William Tell, but their success was due to a polka accompanied by birdsong, imitated perfectly by one of the ocarina players. The effect of the whole concert was excellent and the musicians were called on stage for applause after each piece. We are absolutely certain that these concerts will attract crowds of people, not only for the novelty and peculiarity, but also for the intrinsic quality in the choice of music and for the ability of the artists. The exceedingly difficult Ouverture by William Tell was performed with the strength and precision of a complete orchestra" (London, Daily News, 13 July 1874)</p>
			</div>
			<p><img src="../img/gruppocarine1.jpg" alt="Montagnards des Apenins" class="rfloat" />This is an example of how European newspapers wrote about the concerts performed by the <strong>first ever ocarina group from Budrio</strong> in the 1870's.<br />
			In spite of the fact that Budrio is most certainly not a town in the mountains, the group presented themselves as <em>Société des concertistes italiens surnommés les celèbres Montagnards des Apenins</em>, probably due to the picturesque shepherds costumes from Abruzzo. they wore on stage. The ocarina players were amazingly successful everywhere: <strong>Berlin, Vienna, London, Paris, Barcelona</strong> gave them a warm and interested welcome, as attested by newspapers of the time.</p>
			<p>The group consisted of seven young musicians from Budrio, friends of the inventor Donati: Federico Vignoli, Ulisse Avoni, Alberto Mezzetti, Davide Mignani, Giuseppe Grossi, Ercole Mezzetti, Cesare Vicinelli. Some of them were also graduated from the conservatory.</p>
			<p>Events of great importance (such as the international exhibitions in London and Paris) were the scene of the concerts of this group which mostly performed in front of numerous audiences, in the context of circus shows particularly popular at the time. It's thanks to these international successes that the ocarina spread in <strong>Europe</strong> and later in the <strong>world</strong>.<br />
			Before reaching a similar international success, there is news of a quintet formed by Federico Vignoli (first ocarina), Ulisse Avoni, Giuseppe Donati, Giuseppe Grossi (conductor) and Cesare Vicinelli which, between 1869 and 1872, began to perform in local theaters of Emilia-Romagna and then further and further away (Padua, Venice, Trieste), up to the Roman theaters.</p>
			<p>It was in Rome that in 1870 he was heard and applauded, in the interval of Rigoletto, by <strong>Giuseppe Verdi</strong> himself: that's right, because one of the most requested activities for ocarinists was to play in the foyers of theaters <strong>during the interval of the operas</strong>, taking up the themes and arias that the audience had just heard in the hall, thus accompanying the refreshments that were usually held between one act and another.</p>

			<h2>Ocarina groups in Budrio between the 19th and 20th Century</h2>
			<h3>From Cesare Testi to Alfredo Barattoni</h3>
			<p><img src="../img/gruppocarine2.jpg" alt="secondo gruppo ocarinistico budriese" class="lfloat">The golden Age of the "Montagnards" covers the years between 1869 and 1878, the year when the group broke up and most of its members returned to Italy. During the next twenty years concerts were performed under the direction of <strong>Maestro Cesare Testi</strong>, but unfortunately there is very little documentation regarding this period.<br />
			In 1911 some young players and the elderly Vicinelli and Vignoli achieved great success, performing as a group in Rome at the Ethnic Exhibition in front of thousands of people.<br />
			a typical costume from <em>Romagna</em> was adopted, designed by the painter Augusto Maiani <em>"Nasica"</em>. At the same time the name <em>Montanari dell'Appenino</em> was eliminated and the more sober name <em>Gli Ocarinisti di Budrio</em> was used.<br />
			It was only from 1926 that the group under the direction of Maestro Alfredo Barattoni once again returned to some of its former glory.</p>
			<p>However musical tastes had changed and in spite of the significant success which the group achieved during those years, their activity never regained the international renown which had accompanied the group half a century before. In any case the group performed for almost twenty years in Italian theatres, played on the radio, recorded several records for <em>Columbia</em> and for <em>His Master's Voice</em>, and made sporadic appearances abroad in Switzerland and in Paris.<br />
			This period of activity was important above all for the amazing quality of the compositions and arrangements of maestro Barattoni, many of which were of great musical interest.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="testo maxw">
			<h2>The Centenary Group and their participation in the film "Novecento"</h2>
			<p>After the second World War the group reformed, thanks to the support of some young people who had been pupils of Barattoni. Most of their activities took place locally and the programme of music was essentially <strong>dance music</strong>. Their participation on the television programme <em>"Campanile Sera"</em> in 1958 was significant.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/gruppocarine900.jpg" alt="Gruppo ocarinistico nel film '900'" class="rfloat" />In 1963 the ocarina players took part in the <strong>centenary celebrations for the founding of the first quintet</strong> and the book <em>"L'ocarina di Budrio"</em> by Aldo Adversi was published.
			Between the 1960's and 70's the most significant members of the group were Arrigo Mignani, Tiziano Federici, Paolo Scazzieri, (who as we will see later on played a fundamental role in the formation of a group of young players) Remo Bonfiglioli, Luigi Broccoli, Ettore Antico, Iliano Soverini, Tolmino Maccagnani, Emo Matteuzzi, Erio Venturoli, Nino Tarozzi, Armando Musolesi, Enrico Mattioli, Mario Roveri, Ferruccio Spiga and Enzo Aldrovandi.</p>
			<p>The participation of the group in the film <strong>"Novecento Atto I"</strong>, directed by <strong>Bernardo Bertolucci</strong>, can be considered extremely important and its success marked the revival of a certain interest in the ocarina around the world. The atmosphere of a festive country scene In the film was reproduced by the ocarina players who wandered among the trees and the people dancing, dressed as countrymen.</p>

			<h2>The ocarina school and the groups today</h2>
			<p><img src="../img/classeocarina.jpg" alt="studenti della scuola comunale di ocarina" class="lfloat">
			In 1978 the Municipality of Budrio, fearing that the typical music of the town could be dispersed, entrusted <strong>Paolo Scazzieri</strong>, already a member of the now dissolved ocarinistic group, with the task of organizing free ocarina courses. The initiative attracted a lot of young people and so in a few months an ocarinistic group is reconstituted.</p>
			<p>Over the years, the activity of the young musicians intensified and the Gruppo Ocarinistico Budriese began to travel the world again, bringing the typical sounds of ocarinas to Europe, Australia, South America and enjoying great successes everywhere.<br />
			Nowadays two groups are active in Budrio: the <em><a href="http://www.gobitalia.it" target="_blank">Gruppo Ocarinistico Budriese</a></em>, which aims to enhance the traditional nineteenth-century repertoire, consisting of the pieces originally composed for this instrument and arrangements of opera arias, and the <em><a href="https://www.ocarinaensemble.it/" target="_blank">Ocarina Ensemble</a></em>, which has among its objectives the search for new repertoires and new sounds.</p>
